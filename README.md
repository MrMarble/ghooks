    <h1>YAHM</h1>
    Yet Another Hook Manager
</div>

---

YAHM is a simple cli to manage your git hooks without third dependencies.

## Why?

Because I wanted to. I also don't like using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) because I don't have python on all the computers I use for coding and having to rely on third party repositories to run my hooks is a little weird, especially for running simple commands like `go test ./...` or `npm test` (although husky is :ok_hand: if you use node).
